# Assignment 4: Present your Results

Over the course of this semester you have defined a development related problem, critically analyzed the literature about that problem, developed your central research question, interpreted at least two data science methods that answer (in part) that question, and have suggested a research gap. Now, we will hold a colloquium where you will present your results. Each student will need to write an abstract that represents the sum of the work to be presented. Then each student will need to prepare an 8 minute presentation on their individual work. Finally, you will present your work as part of our 3-day in-class colloquium.

### Step 1. Title & Abstract

Give your presentation a title and write an abstract (1 paragraph summary). Upload your abstract to your GitHub at least two days before your presentation.

### Step 2. Prepare the slides for your presentation

Prepare to speak for 8 minutes and include a presentation slide that addresses each of the following elements from your research:

* An introduction to your selected human development topic. Identify salient harms, quantify their significance, and describe the inherent and complex nature of the human development process you have been investigating. Provide motivation, if the signifance is not obvious: why should we care? Elucidate your research in terms of scope, processes, hierarchy, or dynamics. Permutate through the details of your human development topic.
* State the two+ data science methods you selected. Identify and describe the data sources used as well as incorporated variables and methods of sensing or collection. Describe what each method does and how it advances an improved understanding of your selected human development process. Identify the most salient findings resulting from the application of your data science methods. Be sure to use formulas, tables, charts, graphs, and maps, as needed.
* Identify an area of the literature that requires further investigation. Discuss how data or models fail to describe, analyze, or predict some essential element of your selected human development process. Reformulate your central research question such that it addresses your defined research gap. Position this newly formed central research question in relation to both the broader and more specific questions you had previously articulated.
* Propose a research plan that you will implement in order to answer your central research question. Focus on the design of the plan rather than cost. Keep in mind a 1-3 year time frame from the point of approval and funding to achieving planned goals and objectives.

Post a final draft of your slides to our "humandevelopment_datascience" Slack channel by 11:59pm the day before your presentation.

### Step 3. Present your research during the colloquium

Come prepared to present your work at the agreed upon time. Each speaker will have ~8 minutes to present their work, which will be followed by a brief (~1 minute) question and answer session from the audience.
